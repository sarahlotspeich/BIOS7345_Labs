#Chi-Square distribution

##a) 
Simulate 10,000 independent random observations from a Central Chi-Square distribution with 5 degrees of freedom

```{r}
num_obs <- 10000 #number of observations
deg_free <- 5 #degrees of freedom
```

by first sampling from the standard normal distribution (i.e. $z_i$)

```{r}
#first sample from the N(0,1)
z <- rnorm(n = 5, mean = 0, sd = 1)
```

and working with the sum of the square of the $z_i$'s. 

```{r}
#work with the sum of squared N(0,1)s
u <- sum(z^2)
```

Now, right a function `my_chi_sq()` that does the following: 

  1.  takes in a parameter (`degrees_freedom`) for the desired degrees of freedom (duh),
  2.  has parameters for the mean and variance of the Normal (which defaults to the standard Normal), and
  3.  returns a single chi-squared random variable constructed as above.

```{r}
#now write a function
my_chi_sq <- function(degrees_freedom, mu = 0, sigma = 1)
{
  u <- sum(rnorm(n = degrees_freedom, mean = mu, sd = sigma)^2)
  return(u)
}

#test your function
my_chi_sq(deg_free)
```

Use the `replicate()` function to create a vector of 10,000 random variable constructed using your `my_chi_sq()` function.

```{r}
#use replicate() to create a vector of num_obs chi-squared random variables
central_obs <- replicate(n = num_obs,
                    expr = my_chi_sq(deg_free))
```

Plot the density of the observed chi-square observations with a range of 0 to 60 on the x-axis. 

```{r}
#plot the density of the observed chi-squared obs
central_plot <- ggplot(data = data.frame(central_obs), aes(x = central_obs)) + geom_density() + xlim(c(0,60)) + ggtitle("Chi-squared (df = 5)")
```

Verify that this density plot agrees with the true density for $\chi^2_5$ using the built in `dchisq()` function.

```{r}
#compare your density to the true density of a chi-squared(5)
central_plot <- central_plot + stat_function(fun = dchisq, args = list(df = deg_free), col = "red")
```

##b)
Simulate 10,000 independent random observations from a non-central chi-square distribution with 5 degrees of freedom and non-centrality parameter $\lambda = 2$

```{r}
num_obs <- 10000 #number of observations
deg_free <- 5 #degrees of freedom
lambda <- 2 #non-centrality parameter
```

by first sampling from the normal distribution (i.e. $y_i$), and working with the sum of the square of the $y_i$'s. 

Recall from Rencher (5.22) that $$\lambda = \frac{1}{2}\sum_{i=1}^{n}\mu_i^2,$$ where $n = $ the number of Normals you're summing up (which is also what?).

```{r}
#solve for mu using (5.22)
nc_mu <- sqrt(2*lambda/deg_free)

#sample from the Normal distribution
y <- rnorm(n = deg_free, mean = nc_mu, sd = 1)

#work with the sum of squared Normals
u <- sum(y^2)
```

Now, we can use our handy dandy `my_chi_sq()` function from above to create a vector of 10,000 non-central chi squared observations.

```{r}
#use my_chi_sq() and repliate() to create a vector of non-central chi-squared
noncentral_obs <- replicate(n = num_obs,
                    expr = my_chi_sq(deg_free, mu = nc_mu))
```

Plot the density of the observed non-central chi-square observations with a range of 0 to 60 on the x-axis.

```{r}
#plot the observations
noncentral_plot <- ggplot(data = data.frame(noncentral_obs), aes(x = noncentral_obs)) + geom_density() + xlab(c(0,60)) + ggtitle(label = TeX("Chi-squared (df = 5, $\\lambda$=2)"))
```

Verify that this density plot agrees with the true density for $\chi^2_{5,2}$ using the built in `dchisq()` function. Hint: $\lambda$ in `R` is 2 times $\lambda$ in class (don't ask me why).

```{r}
#compare your density to the true density of a chi-squared(5,2)
noncentral_plot <- noncentral_plot + stat_function(fun = dchisq, args = list(df = deg_free, ncp = 2*lambda), col = "red")
```

##c)
Compare plots from **1a)** to **1b)**.

```{r}
#Plot the central and non-central chi-squared side-by-side
ggarrange(central_plot, noncentral_plot)
```

How do the mean and variance compare between the central and non-central chi-square distributions?

Let's create a dataframe to keep track of these for the three distributions.

```{r}
#make a table so we can view these side-by-side
tab <- data.frame(Dist = "Chi-Squared",
                  Central = paste(round(mean(central_obs), 3), " (", round(var(central_obs),3), ")", sep = ""),
                  NonCentral = paste(round(mean(noncentral_obs), 3), " (", round(var(noncentral_obs),3), ")", sep = ""))
```

#F distribution
##a)
Simulate 10,000 independent random observatios from a central F distribution with 2 and 20 degrees of freedom for the numerator and denominator, respectively.

```{r}
n <- 10000 #number of observations
df_num <- 2 #degrees of freedom (numerator)
df_denom <- 20 #degrees of freedom (denominator)
```

Do this by first sampling from two independent chi-square distributions

```{r}
#sample from two independent chi-square distributions
```

and work with the ratio of the observations.

```{r}
#take the ratio
```

Now, right a function `my_f()` that does the following: 

  1.  takes in degrees of freedom parameters for the numerator and denominator (`degrees_freedom_num`, `degrees_freedom_denom`),
  2.  has a parameter for a noncentrality parameter (`ncp`) (which defaults to 0), and
  3.  returns a single F random variable constructed as above.

```{r}
#now write a function

#test your function

```

Use the `replicate()` function to create a vector of 10,000 random variable constructed using your `my_f()` function.

```{r}
#use replicate to create a vector of F observartions

```

Plot the density of the observed F distribution with a range of 0 to 20 on the x-axis.

```{r}
#plot your observations
```

Verify that this density plot agrees with the true density for $F_{2,20}$ using the built in `df()` function.

```{r}
#compare your density to the true density of a F(2,20)

```

##b)
Simulate 10,000 independent random observations from a non-central F distribution with 2 and 20 degrees of freedom for the numerator and denominator, respectively, and a non-centrality parameter $\lambda = 2$.

```{r}
n <- 10000 #number of observations
df_num <- 2 #degrees of freedom (numerator)
df_denom <- 20 #degrees of freedom (denominator)
lambda <- 2 #non-centrality parameter
```

Do this by first sampling from two independent (possibly non-central) chi-square distributions (recalling that `R` parameterizes $\lambda$ differently)

```{r}
#sample from chi-square

```

and work with the ratio of the observations.

```{r}
#take the ratio

```

Now, we can use our handy dandy `my_f()` function from above to create a vector of 10,000 non-central F observations.

```{r}
#use my_f() and replicate() to create a vector of 10,000
```

Plot the density of the observed non-central chi-square observations with a range of 0 to 60 on the x-axis.

```{r}
#plot the observations

```

Verify that this density plot agrees with the true density for $F_{2,20}(2)$ using the built in `df()` function. Recall: $\lambda$ in `R` is 2 times $\lambda$ in class (don't ask me why).

```{r}
#compare your density to the true density of a F(2,20,2)

```

##c)
Compare the plots from **2a)** and **2b)**.

```{r}
#plot central and non-central side-by-side

```

How do the mean and variance compare between the central and non-central F distributions? Let's append a row to our dataframe for the F distribution.

```{r}
#append a row to your table for the F distribution

```

#T distribution
##a)
Simulate 10,000 independent random observations from a central T distribution with 2 degrees of freedom

```{r}
num_obs <- 10000 #number of observations
deg_free <- 2 #degrees of freedom
```

by first sampling from the standard normal distribution (i.e. $z_i$)

```{r}
#sample from the N(0,1)

```

and from an independent chi-square distribution,

```{r}
#sample from a chi-square

```

and working with the ratio of the two observations.

```{r}
#work with the ratio

```

Now, right a function `my_t()` that does the following: 

  1.  takes in a degrees of freedom parameter (`degrees_freedom`),
  2.  has a parameter for a noncentrality parameter (`ncp`) (which both default to 0), and
  3.  returns a single t random variable constructed as above.

```{r}
#now write a function

#test your function

```

Use the `replicate()` function to create a vector of 10,000 random variable constructed using your `my_t()` function.

```{r}
#use replicate to create 10,000 observations

```

Plot the density of the constructed T observations with a range of -40 to 40 on the x-axis.

```{r}
#plot your 10,000 observations

```

Verify that this density plot agrees with the true density for $t_{2}$ using the built in `dt()` function.

```{r}
#compare your density to the true density of a t(2)

```

##b)
Simulate 10,000 independent random observations from a non-central T distribution with 2 degrees of freedom and non-centrality parameter $\mu = -3$

```{r}
n <- 10000 #number of observations
deg_free <- 2 #degrees of freedom
mu <- -3 #non-centrality parameter
```

by first sampling from the normal distribution (i.e. $y_i$)

```{r}
#sample from a Normal

```

and from an independent chi-square distribution,

```{r}
#sample from a chi-square

```

and working with the ratio of the two observations.

```{r}
#work with the ratio

```

Now, we can use our handy dandy `my_t()` function from above to create a vector of 10,000 non-central t observations.

```{r}
#use my_t() and replicate() to create a vector of 10,000
```

Plot the density of the observed T observations with a range from -40 to 40 on the x-axis.

```{r}
#plot the observations

```

Verify that this density plot agrees with the true density for $F_{2,20}(2)$ using the built in `df()` function. Recall: $\lambda$ in `R` is 2 times $\lambda$ in class (don't ask me why).

```{r}
#compare your density to the true density of a t(2,20)

```

Verify that this density plot agrees with a similar plot using the built-in `rt()` function with a non-centrality parameter.

##c)
Compare the plots from **3a)** and **3b)**.

```{r}
#plot central and non-central side-by-side

```

How do the mean and variance compare between the central and non-central t distributions? Let's append a row to our dataframe for the t distribution.

```{r}
#add a row to your table for the t distribution

```

#Discussion

Use the `xtable()` function to print a PDF-friendly version of your table comparing the mean/variance between the central and non-central versions of these distributions.

```{r, results = 'asis'}
#use xtable() to print your table
#try to add a descriptive caption
